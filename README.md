# West Nile Virus Analysis

## Introduction

West Nile virus is a virus that causes West Nile fever. It is most commonly spread to humans through infected mosquitos. Around 20% of people who become infected with the virus develop symptoms ranging from a persistent fever, to serious neurological illnesses that can result in death.

In Chicago, the first human cases of West Nile virus were reported in 2002. By 2004 the City of Chicago and the Chicago Department of Public Health (CDPH) established a comprehensive surveillance and control program against West Nile virus. Every week from late spring through the fall, mosquitos in traps across the city are tested for the virus. The results of these tests have been collected over the years.


### Problem Statement

As analysts in Disease And Treatment Agency, we will be analyzing how weather conditions and environmental factors are affecting spatiotemporal variance of mosquito presence. The goal of this project is to develop a robust and efficient model using weather and environmental data to predict the presence of WNV and produce a list of WNV locations and recommend strategies to spray pesticides to control WNV. Public health managers could use prediction maps and cost benefit analysis to guide ongoing decisions about when and where to focus intervention strategies for WNV.

The aim of the project will be to predict the most number of true positives (actual potential WNV locations) while minimizing number of false positives to reduce cost of spraying. As such, ROC-AUC score will be the main evaluation matrix for this project.


### Executive Summary

The most important features to identify if a place will have Wile Nile virus is the location features. Other than that weather data such as average wind speed, sea level and average temperature are also important in the prediction. Other important factors include time, such as week of the year and the year itself, and also the species of the mosquito, specifically whether the Culex Restuans species is present.

Using the train data set and external research paper, a preliminary socio-economic cost was estimated to be USD 4,909,695 and an estimated spray cost prediction was USD 413,424 or 8.4% of socio-economic cost.
Once the predictions are derived, a cost benefit analysis was done looking at various options of spray strategies. The results were compared with the preliminary cost analysis done on the train data set to arrive at the recommended options.

Spray only predicted locations for each month but only for Aug and Sep (Option 4), maximize the cost benefits at an estimated USD 263,088 or 5.4% of projected socio-economic cost while taking a higher risk of increase in WnvPresent location.
On the other hand, Spray all predicted locations for all four months (Option 1), minimizes this risk while taking on a higher cost of spray at an estimated USD 413,424 or 11.99% of projected socio-economic cost.

It is recommended that the City of Chicago and CPHD take a collective review of the options to arrive at a viable decision.

### Datasets Used

Detailed weather data from 2007 to 2014 and location data on WNV cases is made available for this project. There are total of 4 datasets with close to 120,000 data points. Total number of original features available for this analysis is 38.

This analysis will start with exploratory data analysis to observe the pattern and relationship between features and our target variable and followed by detailed feature selection process and explanation of modeling results.
